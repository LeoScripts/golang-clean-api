API developed using good software development practices with the intention of making the concept of clean architecture visible.

With that in mind, I left the database in memory (to make it easier for users, especially beginners), simulating the flow of how it would be with a real database, whether PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or any other you prefer, as the flow is quite similar.

Treat this project as a laboratory where you can modify and play around with it, haha. I hope it is very useful in your development.

Other important points are:

- The folder structure is not the most common one for Golang, but I really liked it, haha.
- Environment variables – I didn’t add them to simplify things (I have other projects with this configuration ready, and I’ll upload them here to GitHub soon).
- [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) (automatically restarts the server after modifications) – I’ve already configured it if you want to use it.
  - If you don’t have it installed, just run the command below in the terminal.

```bash
go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```
```diff
- Attention

+ For security reasons, occasionally use the command "go run".
```
